# Smart Office Management System

## Overview

The Smart Office Management System is a console-based application designed to manage office space efficiently. It handles room configurations, bookings, and occupancy tracking, including automated control of room amenities and notifications for bookings.

## Prerequisites

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**
   - Ensure JDK 11 or higher is installed.
   - [Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)

2. **Database Server**
   - **MySQL** or **SQL Server**.
   - Install and configure the database server.
   - [MySQL Installation Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/8.0/en/)
   - [SQL Server Installation Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/install/install-sql-server)

3. **Database Connection**
   - Ensure the `DatabaseConnection` class is properly configured to connect to your database.

## Setup and Configuration

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-office-management.git
cd smart-office-management
```

### 2. Configure Database

1. **Create Database and Tables:**
   - Run the provided SQL scripts to create necessary tables:
     - `rooms`
     - `bookings`
     - `occupants`

2. **Database Schema:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE rooms (
       roomId INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       occupied BOOLEAN,
       maxCapacity INT
   );

   CREATE TABLE bookings (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       roomId INT,
       username VARCHAR(255),
       startTime DATETIME,
       endTime DATETIME,
       FOREIGN KEY (roomId) REFERENCES rooms(roomId)
   );

   CREATE TABLE occupants (
       roomId INT,
       numberOfOccupants INT,
       currentOccupants INT,
       PRIMARY KEY (roomId),
       FOREIGN KEY (roomId) REFERENCES rooms(roomId)
   );
   ```

### 3. Update Database Connection

- Modify the `DatabaseConnection` class in your Java code to include the correct database URL, username, and password.

### 4. Build and Run the Application

1. **Compile and Build:**
   - Use your preferred IDE (e.g., NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA) or command line to compile the Java files.
